# Arbitrum is a **Layer 2 network** built on top of Ethereum. It makes using Ethereum faster and cheaper by processing many transactions off-chain and then sending the result back to Ethereum.

The token of Arbitrum is called **ARB**.

* You **donâ€™t use ARB to pay fees** (fees are paid in ETH).
* ARB is a **governance token**, which means holders can vote on decisions about the future of the Arbitrum network.
* It gives the community power over upgrades, funding, and development.

In short: **Ethereum is slow and expensive, Arbitrum is faster and cheaper. ARB is the token that lets people help run the system.
